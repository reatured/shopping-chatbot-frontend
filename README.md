## Backend API Endpoints

This project uses the E-commerce Chatbot API (backend) located in `ecommerce-chatbot-api/`. Below is a consolidated reference of the available endpoints, their purpose, parameters, example usage, and sample responses to help the frontend integrate with the backend.

Note: All endpoints are served under the same host where the backend is deployed. Replace `BASE_URL` with your backend origin (for local development this may be `http://localhost:8000`).

### 1) Health / Root
- Route: `GET /`
- Description: Basic health check and endpoint discovery. Returns a list of available routes and notes.
- Parameters: none
- Sample use (curl):

	GET ${BASE_URL}/

- Sample response:

	{
		"status": "ok",
		"message": "E-commerce Chatbot API is running",
		"endpoints": {
			"init": "/api/init",
			"anthropic_chat": "/api/chat/anthropic/stream",
			"products_list": "/api/products?category={category}&color={color}",
			"products_search": "/api/products/search?q={query}",
			"product_by_id": "/api/products/{id}"
		},
		"notes": { ... }
	}

### 2) Initialize App
- Route: `GET /api/init`
- Description: Wake backend specifically for my online deployment on Render as it need 30 seconds to be awake after long time of inactivity.
- Parameters: none
- Sample use (curl):

	GET ${BASE_URL}/api/init

- Sample response:

	{
		"status": "ready",
		"categories": ["car", "backpack"],
		"metadata": {
			"total_products": 50,
			"colors_available": ["red","blue","black"],
			"last_updated": "2025-10-10T12:00:00Z",
			"cache_ttl_seconds": 300
		}
	}

### 3) List Products
- Route: `GET /api/products`
- Description: Returns all products with optional filters for `category` and `color`.
- Query parameters:
	- `category` (optional) ‚Äî Filter by product category (e.g., `car`, `backpack`).
	- `color` (optional) ‚Äî Filter by color.
- Sample use (curl):

	GET ${BASE_URL}/api/products?category=backpack&color=blue

- Sample response (truncated):

	{
		"products": [
			{
				"id": 1,
				"name": "Blue Hiking Backpack",
				"brand": "TrailCo",
				"price": 79.99,
				"color": "Blue",
				"category": "backpack",
				"description": "A durable hiking backpack...",
				"image_url": "https://...",
				"tags": "hiking,outdoor"
			}
		],
		"count": 1,
		"filters": {"category": "backpack", "color": "blue"}
	}

### 4) Search Products
- Route: `GET /api/products/search`
- Description: Full-text keyword search across `name`, `description`, `brand`, `tags`, and `color`.
- Query parameters:
	- `q` (required) ‚Äî Search query string (minimum 2 characters).
	- `category` (optional) ‚Äî Limit search to a specific category.
- Sample use (curl):

	GET ${BASE_URL}/api/products/search?q=waterproof+backpack&category=backpack

- Sample response (truncated):

	{
		"products": [ /* matching product objects */ ],
		"count": 3,
		"query": "waterproof backpack",
		"category": "backpack"
	}

### 5) Get Product by ID
- Route: `GET /api/products/{product_id}`
- Description: Retrieve a single product by its integer ID.
- Path parameters:
	- `product_id` (required) ‚Äî integer product id.
- Sample use (curl):

	GET ${BASE_URL}/api/products/123

- Sample response (product object):

	{
		"id": 123,
		"name": "Sample Product",
		"brand": "Brand",
		"price": 49.99,
		"color": "black",
		"category": "car",
		"description": "Full product description...",
		"image_url": "https://...",
		"tags": "auto,accessory"
	}

### 6) Dynamic Metadata / Field Values
- Route: internal helper: `get_field_metadata(products, field=None, category_filter=None)`
- Description: The backend exposes a metadata helper to list available product fields or unique values for a specific field (used by the `/api/init` endpoint and internal tools). There is no public HTTP route for arbitrary metadata other than what `/api/init` returns. If you need a public metadata endpoint, consider adding `GET /api/metadata?field=...&category=...` that wraps `get_field_metadata`.

If you'd like a public API for metadata (recommended for richer frontend filtering UI), here's a suggested HTTP endpoint that wraps the helper and can be added to the backend.

- Route (suggested): `GET /api/metadata`
- Description: Return available product fields, or unique values for a specific field, optionally scoped to a category.
- Query parameters:
	- `field` (optional) ‚Äî name of the product field to analyze (e.g., `color`, `brand`, `tags`). If omitted, the endpoint returns available fields and field types.
	- `category` (optional) ‚Äî limit metadata extraction to products in this category (e.g., `car`, `backpack`).

- Sample use (curl):

		GET ${BASE_URL}/api/metadata?field=color&category=backpack

- Sample success response (values for a specific field):

		{
			"field": "color",
			"values": [
				{"value": "blue", "count": 12},
				{"value": "black", "count": 8},
				{"value": "red", "count": 3}
			],
			"total_products": 50,
			"unique_count": 3
		}

- Sample success response (no field specified):

		{
			"available_fields": ["id","name","category","brand","price","color","description","image_url","tags"],
			"field_types": {
				"id": "numeric",
				"price": "numeric",
				"name": "categorical",
				"category": "categorical",
				"brand": "categorical",
				"color": "categorical",
				"tags": "categorical"
			},
			"total_products": 50
		}

- Sample error response (invalid field):

		{
			"error": "Field 'nonexistent_field' not found",
			"available_fields": ["id","name","category","brand","price","color","description","image_url","tags"]
		}

Implementation note: The backend already implements `get_field_metadata(products, field=None, category_filter=None)`. Exposing `GET /api/metadata` is a small wrapper that should call `fetch_products_from_sheet()` and return the helper's result.
